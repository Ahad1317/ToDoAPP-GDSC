<H1>ToDo Application </H1>
<h2>This was supposed to be a frontend application, But i tried to go a step further and build this as a full stack application, The website is build over the following stacks:<br>
<ul>
<li>express</li>
<li>mongoose</li>
<li>react</li>
<li>dotenv</li>
<li>node</li>
</ul>
<br>
I have used mongoDB for database storage and tested API's with postman.
It was mistaken with the Quiz app in the gdsc form.
